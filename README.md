# Flutter Template App

Template Flutter project.

# 1. Delete any .git folder and initialize a new git repository if necessary. Keep the .gitignore file.

# 2. Rename the Flutter app from `template_app` to the desired name of your app.

1. **Change Package/Bundle ID:**
   - **Android:** Edit `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and change the `android:label` attribute to `Name Of Your App`.
   - **iOS:** Change `CFBundleDisplayName` and `CFBundleName` in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`. Open the
     project in Xcode and change the `Bundle Identifier` in the `General` tab of the Runner target and
     also in the `Signing & Capabilities` tab.

2. **Update Configuration Files:**
   - Modify `applicationId` in `android/app/build.gradle`.
   - Update Firebase configurations if used (`google-services.json` for Android, `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS).

3. **Rename Project Folder:**
   - Rename your project folder to `template_app`.

4. **Update Dart Code References:**
   - Update any Dart code references to the package name.

5. **Update App Name:**
   - Change the name in `pubspec.yaml` under the `name` field.

6. **Rename imports:**
   - Rename the imports in the files using the rename_imports.sh script in the root folder of the project.
      - Run `chmod +x rename-imports.sh` to make the script executable.
      - Run `./rename-imports.sh name_of_your_project` to rename the imports.

7. **Clean and Rebuild the Project:**
   - Run `flutter clean`.
   - Run `flutter pub get`.
   - Rebuild the project for both platforms.

8. **Run a clean install of Pods:**
   - Go to the ios folder and run `pod cache clean --all`, `pod deintegrate` and `pod install`.

9. **Check Platform-Specific Configurations:**
   - **Android:** Review `build.gradle` and `settings.gradle`.
   - **iOS:** Adjust settings in Xcode, including project name, targets, and `Info.plist`.

10. **Update External Service References:**
- Update the app name in external services (Firebase, APIs, etc.) as needed.

### Important Naming Conventions and Restrictions:

1. **Directories**:
   - **Allowed**: Underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`), letters, and numbers.
   - **Not Allowed**: Spaces, special characters like `@`, `#`, `&`, etc.

2. **Package Name (in `pubspec.yaml`)**:
   - **Allowed**: Only underscores (`_`), lowercase letters, and numbers.
   - **Not Allowed**: Hyphens (`-`), spaces, uppercase letters, special characters.
   - Example: `my_package_name`

3. **Bundle ID (iOS)**:
   - **Allowed**: Dots (`.`), letters, and numbers.
   - **Not Allowed**: Underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`), spaces, special characters.
   - Example: `com.example.myapp`

4. **Firebase iOS ID**:
   - **Allowed**: Dots (`.`), letters, and numbers.
   - **Not Allowed**: Underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`), spaces, special characters.
   - Example: `com.example.myapp`

5. **Firebase Android ID**:
   - **Allowed**: Dots (`.`), letters, and numbers.
   - **Not Allowed**: Underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`), spaces, special characters.
   - Example: `com.example.myapp`

# 3. Add Firebase to the Flutter app (using FlutterFire):

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Click on "Add Project" and follow the setup instructions.

2. **Setup Firebase in the App:**
   - Follow these instructions: https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup.

# 4. Check the supported locales or add new locales (Optional):

1. **Check Supported Locales:**
   - You can find the supported locales in the `lib/config.dart` file, under supportedLocales List.

2. **Add or Remove Locales:**
   - Add a locale creating a file named `intl_{locale}.arb` in the `lib/l10n` folder.
   - Run `flutter pub run intl_utils:generate` to generate the locale files.
   - Remove a locale by deleting the corresponding `intl_{locale}.arb` file and taking it out of the supportedLocales List.

# 5. Add SHA-1 and SHA-256 keys to Firebase (Android - Optional):
- Use the command `keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android` to get the SHA-1 key.
- Paste the SHA-1 key in the Firebase project settings under the Android app.

# 6. Add Google URL scheme support to the Info.plist file (iOS - Optional):
- When trying to sign in with Google and the Google URL Scheme is not set, the app will crash and show a log similar to this one:
- `*** Error trying to signing in user using Google: PlatformException(google_sign_in, Your app is missing support for the following URL schemes: com.googleusercontent.apps.99xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, NSInvalidArgumentException, null)`.
- In that case you should add the Google URL Scheme `com.googleusercontent.apps.99xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` to the Info.plist file this way:
  `<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
  <array>
    <dict>
       <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
       <string>Editor</string>
       <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
       <array>
          <string>com.googleusercontent.apps.99xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</string>
       </array>
    </dict>
  </array>`
